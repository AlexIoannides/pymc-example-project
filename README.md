# Example PyMC3 Project for Bayesian Data Analysis

This repository contains an example Bayesian data analysis, using data collected from a set of multiple-lot online auction events executed in Europen markets, over the period of a year. It contains a Jupyter notebook in which we build interpretable models of the average Return-on-Reserve (RoR), using variables that describe various facets of multiple-lot online auction events - e.g. the average number of bidders per-lot. We use probabilitic programming methods as implemented in the PyMC3 package, for (Bayesian) model inference.

The ultimate aim of this endeavour is for this repository is to serve as a template project-workflow for conducting an end-to-end Bayesian data analysis using PyMC3. It includes many helper functions for automating otherwise tedious tasks (e.g. interacting with Theano to score models on test data, or handling PyMC3 back-ends to avoid having to recompute MCMC sampling), as well as examples of how data pre-processing can be integrated with Scikit-Learn.

The overall approach to statistical (scientific) workflow has been heavily inspired by the book 'Statistical Rethinking - A Bayesian Course with Examples in R and Stan', by Richard McElreath http://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/, which is the most significant book on statistics and modelling that I have read during a career spanning more than a decade.

## Project Dependencies

We use [pipenv](https://docs.pipenv.org) for managing project dependencies and Python environments (i.e. virtual environments). All of the direct packages dependencies required to run the code (e.g. NumPy for arrays/tensors and Pandas for DataFrames), as well as all the packages used during development (e.g. IPython and JupyterLab as the chosen development environment), are described in the `Pipfile`. Their **precise** downstream dependencies are described in `Pipfile.lock`.

### Installing Pipenv

To get started with Pipenv, first of all download it - assuming that there is a global version of Python available on your system and on the PATH, then this can be achieved by running the following command,

```bash
pip3 install pipenv
```

Pipenv is also available to install from many non-Python package managers. For example, on OS X it can be installed using the [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) package manager, with the following terminal command,

```bash
brew install pipenv
```

For more information, including advanced configuration options, see the [official pipenv documentation](https://docs.pipenv.org).

### Installing this Projects' Dependencies

Make sure that you're in the project's root directory (the same one in which the `Pipfile` resides), and then run,

```bash
pipenv install --dev
```

This will install all of the direct project dependencies as well as the development dependencies (the latter a consequence of the `--dev` flag).

### Running Python, IPython and JupyterLab from the Project's Virtual Environment

In order to continue development in a Python environment that precisely mimics the one the project was initially developed with, use Pipenv from the command line as follows,

```bash
pipenv run python3
```

The `python3` command could just as well be `ipython3` or the JupterLab, for example,

```bash
pipenv run jupyter lab
```

This will fire-up JupyterLab *where the default Python 3 kernel includes all of the direct and development project dependencies*. This is how we advise that the notebooks within this project are used.

### Pipenv Shells

Prepending `pipenv` to every command you want to run within the context of your Pipenv-managed virtual environment, can get very tedious. This can be avoided by entering into a Pipenv-managed shell,

```bash
pipenv shell
```

which is equivalent to 'activating' the virtual environment. Any command will now be executed within the virtual environment. Use `exit` to leave the shell session.
